This is most of the code for the Positioning System and its simulation. I have removed the parts that are currently being worked on and parts that will be irrelevant to the final system (ex: User simulation).

The functions that will need to be changed are:
	alertController in AccessPoint
	setPosition in AccessPoint
	setPosition in Controller
